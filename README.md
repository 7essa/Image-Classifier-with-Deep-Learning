# Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning 🌼 🔍 🌻

## About 
### The project 

- The project divided in two parts

            - Part one : Work through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with TensorFlow.
            
            - Part two : Use the saved Keras model from part one and use it to build application that others can use.The application should be a Python script that run from the command line. 
            
-  The project is an course project proviede by [**Udacity**](www.udacity.com) for Machine Learning Nano Degree 


### The dataset 
* Dataset available on [Oxford Flowers 102 dataset.](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102)

## Getting Started
### Software and Libraries
 -  [tfds-nightly package](https://pypi.org/project/tfds-nightly/)
 - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).
 - [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
 - [tensorflow datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets).
 - [tensorflow hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub)
 
 Also, You will need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook.](https://jupyter.org/)
